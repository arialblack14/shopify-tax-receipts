  <h3>How it Works</h3>
  <p>We listen for new orders on your shop and if one of the orders contains a product which you've setup to receive a tax receipt then we take care of it. Your customers will receive a second email (in addition to their order receipt from Shopify) containing a PDF tax receipt for their donation.</p>

  <h3>Adding Donations to Products</h3>
  <p>To select which products should recieve tax receipts on purchase go to your <a href=<%="#{current_shop_url}/admin/products"%> target="_blank">products</a> page and use the bulk dropdown</p>
